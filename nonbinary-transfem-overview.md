##  介绍

“[非二元][2]” 指的是不认同自身属于 [性别二元][3] 范畴内的跨性别人群。尽管ta们不认同于男性或女性，许多非二元 [男性倾向跨性别者][4] 和 [女性倾向跨性别者][5] 仍希望接受激素治疗，就像跨性别男性和女性一样。虽然有些非二元者选择了像多数认同二元性别的跨性别者一样的完整激素过渡，许多非二元者更倾向于仅实现部分激素过渡。这可能是为了实现在 [男性与女性特征][6] 之间的一个中间区域，从而实现更 [性别中立的外观][7]，或诱导一部分但不是全部方面的 [男性化][8] 或 [女性化][9]。

也有一些人寻求荷尔蒙的女性化和/或 [去男性化][10]，但却并不认同自己是跨性别。这些顺性别认同的人们常常称自己为 “[伪娘][11]”。这些人的社区在 [Reddit][12] 等社交媒体网站上存在 (如，[r/FemboyTransition][13])。倾向于女性化的顺性别者在追求激素过渡的时候，常常与女性倾向非二元者有着相似的偏好—其中最常见的是没有 [乳房发育][14] 的女性化。有时，这些起初顺性别认同并接受激素治疗的人们，会随着时间的推移最终发展成跨性别身份。

激素过渡的部分方法，甚至对于非二元的广泛认同，都是相当新的发展。在已发表的文献中，关于这种非常规的激素治疗的描写非常少。此外，目前还没有关于这种治疗的可用 [标准或指南][15]。然而，最近的一些综述已经开始讨论非二元激素治疗的可能性 ([Richards et al., 2016][16]; [Seal, 2017][17]; [Bass et al., 2018][18]; [Cocchetti et al., 2020][19])。目前在渴望非常规激素过渡的人数与这种疗法的临床建立之间存在不协调。因此，从理论角度对各种可能性进行探索将是有价值的，也是本综述的目的。

作为免责声明，本文中的观点是实验性的和初步的。截至目前，还没有在跨性别人群中进行的以部分激素过渡为目标的研究，也没有在非二元者中的数据或证据证实该种方法的使用。因此，我们目前只能从其他群体的理论和研究中推断。在跨性别非二元激素治疗的情况下，这些其他群体的例子包括接受前列腺癌治疗的顺性别男性、正在接受 [雌性样乳腺发育][20] (男性乳房发育) 治疗的顺性别男性，和接受激素治疗的跨性别女性。由于这些原因，本讨论是探索性的，不应作为治疗建议。

##  常规的女性化激素治疗

对跨性别女性进行常规激素治疗的目的是产生可能的最大限度的去男性化与女性化——包括乳房发育。这是通过抑制 [睾酮][21] 水平和提高 [雌激素][22] 水平来实现的，使它们都处于正常的成年女性范围内。除了完全抑制睾酮水平，另一种方法是阻断睾酮的作用。相关的激素变化是通过服用 [激素药物][23] 完成的，包括 [雌激素][24]，[孕酮][25]，和/或 [抗雄激素][26]。雌激素产生女性化，包括乳房发育，而睾酮抑制产生去男性化——以及防止抑制女性化。雌激素、孕激素和抗雄激素都可以促进睾酮的抑制。

常规的 [女性化激素治疗][27] 中使用的具体药物包括 [雌二醇][28] 和 [雌二醇酯][29]，如 [戊酸雌二醇][30]；抗雄激素如 [螺内酯][31]，[比卡鲁胺][32] 和 [促性腺激素释放激素 (GnRH) 激动剂][33] and [拮抗剂][34]；以及孕激素如 [孕酮][35] 和 [醋酸环丙孕酮][36] (CPA)。[雄激素合成抑制剂][37]，如 [5α-还原酶抑制剂][38] (5α-RIs) 也被使用。5α-RI抑制睾酮代谢为更有效的 [双氢睾酮][39] (DHT)，这种转化只发生在某些组织中。它们具有有限的组织选择性抗雄激素作用，体现在在皮肤和毛囊上。

一部分非二元女性倾向跨性别者的治疗目标等同于跨性别女性的治疗目标，因此与常规的女性化激素治疗的效果相一致。也就是说，治疗的目的是最大可能的女性化（包括乳房发育）和去男性化。有这些偏好的非二元跨性别者可以简单地使用常规的女性化激素疗法来进行激素过渡，而不是采用更多的实验性和非常规的部分方法。

关于常规的女性化激素治疗的全面介绍，请参见这篇文章：

上述文章旨在提供人们对跨性别用药实现基本了解所需要的一切内容。如果你刚刚了解跨性别激素治疗这一主题，强烈建议在继续阅读当前文章之前阅读上述文章。该篇文章的介绍涵盖了性激素、它们的影响、使用的具体激素药物、途径和这种激素疗法的剂量。这些信息大部分也适用于非常规的女性化激素治疗。

##  部分的女性化激素治疗 

一些非二元女性倾向跨性别者 (以及寻求激素女性化的顺性别认同者) 只希望部分女性化和/或去男性化。根据不同的具体目的，这可能比常规的激素治疗更复杂，并需要更多的考量。以下女性化激素治疗的目的可能会被遇到：

  * 介于男性和女性之间的一种身体和激素状态
  * 更加中性或雌雄同体的外观
  * 较多或最大程度上的女性化和去男性化，但较少或没有的乳房发育。
  * 较多或最大程度上的女性化和去男性化，但较少或没有的性欲与性能力减少 (如，勃起和性高潮能力) 和/或 生育能力

第一种选项是相当直接的，因为它仅需常规女性化激素治疗的较低剂量即可完成，这将导致部分睾酮被抑制，雄激素和雌激素混合作为主要的活性性激素。第二种选项涵盖对于雄激素和雌激素两者的去除。虽然这是可能的，但是其也许会产生负面影响，因为性激素对维持健康和良好的某些方面很重要。然而，有一些方法可以避免或减轻这种后果。第三和第四种选择也是可能的，但是更难实现，并需要专门的、可能是复杂的激素疗法。

##  睾酮的抑制和阻断

如果非二元女性化激素治疗的目标仅仅是为了实现中性化的外观，并且尽量减少或不出现女性化的迹象，这可以通过去除睾酮并且不同时给予雌激素来完成。在出生时被指定为男性的人中，有多种方法可以实现雄激素的去除或睾酮的压制。这些方法包括大剂量的孕激素治疗、使用GnRH激动剂/拮抗剂或性腺切除术进行药物和手术去性腺、大剂量雄激素受体拮抗剂治疗，以及其他一些可能性。在本节中，作者将主要从疗效的角度来讨论雄激素去除疗法。然而，由于雌激素缺乏的共同后果，单纯的去除雄激素在耐受性和安全性方面存在问题，这将会被在下一节中讨论。

###  大剂量孕激素对雄激素的抑制作用 

雄激素的去除可以通过大剂量的孕激素来实现，这能够抑制睾酮水平高达50%至70% ([Aly W., 2019][41])。这是一个大幅下降的睾酮水平，但是还没有完全进入女性范围。如果需要，还可以加入雄激素受体拮抗剂，从而阻断未被抑制的剩余睾酮。出于这些目的，低剂量的醋酸环丙孕酮 (如，5.0–12.5 mg/天) ([Aly W., 2019][41]) 以及比卡鲁胺 (如，12.5–50 mg/天) 或螺内酯 (如，200–400 mg/天) 可能是一种有效的治疗方案。作为醋酸环丙孕酮的替代品，可以使用大剂量的其他孕激素，如几乎所有的人工孕酮，或者通过直肠给药的孕酮 ([Aly W., 2018][42])。

   [42]: https://transfemscience.org/articles/oral-p4-rectally/

###  药物或手术性腺切除对雄激素的抑制作用 

GnRH激动剂和拮抗剂是抑制睾酮的另外一种选择。这些药物可以将睾酮水平抑制约95%，即进入正常女性范围或性腺去除的男性范围 (<50 ng/dL)。然而，GnRH激动剂和拮抗剂非常昂贵，尽管可能有一些可行的选择可以更便宜地活的它们 (如，从某些网上药店/供应商处购买) ([Aly W., 2019][43])。 

   [43]: https://transfemscience.org/articles/buserelin-inexpensive/

性腺切除术，或手术切除性腺，可以作为GnRH激动剂和拮抗剂的一个更永久的替代方法。然而，这种过程很昂贵 (几千美元)，需要做一个小手术，并且可能更难获取。大多数外科医生需要性别治疗师的信件和真实的生活体验 (RLE)；但确实存在知情同意即可的外科医生。性腺切除术也是不可逆的，特别是会造成睾丸的永久性丧失和不育。在任何情况下，从长远来看，性腺切除术比GnRH激动剂和拮抗剂要便宜的多，也更方便。

   [44]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-life_experience_(transgender)

###  抗雄激素对雄激素的阻断作用 

雄激素受体拮抗剂如比卡鲁胺和螺内酯的作用是直接与雄激素受体结合，将睾酮和双氢睾酮等雄激素从受体中置换出来，从而阻止这些雄激素对其的激活。这与通过抑制雄激素的产生和水平而发挥作用的疗法不同。

高剂量的比卡鲁胺单药治疗 (如，150–300 mg/天) 是雄性激素去除治疗的一种选择 ([Aly W., 2019][45])。然而，比卡鲁胺单药治疗会增加睾酮，从而增加雌二醇水平。睾酮会被比卡鲁胺阻断，不会产生影响，但雌二醇会被增加到允许明显或完全女性化的浓度范围，这包括乳房发育。此外，仅使用比卡鲁胺，即使是非常高的剂量，也可能不足以完全阻断男性范围的睾酮 ([Aly W., 2019][45])。基于这些考量，如果目标是没有女性化或乳房发育的完全去男性化，比卡鲁胺单药治疗本身并不可以实现。

   [45]: https://transfemscience.org/articles/bica-dosage/

高剂量的比卡鲁胺是昂贵的，这可能令人难以承受。高剂量的螺内酯单药治疗不是这种途径的好选择，因为它是一种相对较弱的抗雄激素，可能远远不能处理男性范围内的睾酮水平 (似乎需要至少 200 mg/天 才能完全阻止女性睾酮水平; [Aly W., 2018][46]; [维基][47])。通过额外使用孕激素 (如，醋酸环丙孕酮) 同时部分抑制睾酮和雌激素水平可能是比单独使用雄激素受体拮抗剂更可行的选择。

   [47]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics_of_spironolactone#Antiandrogenic_activity

高剂量比卡鲁胺单药治疗的一些潜在主要优势是，与明显或完全抑制睾酮水平相比，比卡鲁胺单药治疗在很大程度上保留了性欲和勃起功能，并且可能不会导致不孕。

###  抑制雄激素的其他选项 

另一种选择是仅进行部分去男性化，这基本上可以通过使用较低剂量的上述药物 (如，醋酸环丙孕酮、比卡鲁胺) 来实现。如果需要，在这种情况下可以加入5α-还原酶抑制剂，以更大幅度地减少头皮脱发和体毛生长。需要注意的是，如果睾酮被很充分的抑制或阻断，那么使用5α-还原酶抑制剂的好处可能会很少或完全没有。

另一种可能性是加入低剂量的 [癸酸诺龙][48]，一种雄性激素受体激动剂和合成代谢雄性激素 (AAS)，对皮肤和毛囊的男性化/雄性激素作用要小的多 ([Aly W., 2020][49])。这种AAS可以帮助抑制和替代睾酮水平。 癸酸诺龙也可能有帮助维持性欲和功能的好处。然而，癸酸诺龙最近在美国已经停产了。[奥沙隆][50] 是另一种类似的AAS，但与肝脏毒性有关。

##  雌激素的缺乏和替代

While androgen deprivation therapy is effective for achieving the desired changes—specifically demasculinization without feminization—it is not recommended by itself. This is because estradiol is produced from testosterone and hence androgen deprivation results in estrogen deficiency as well. Estrogens are essential for maintaining [bone density][51] in both men and women, and without them, a person will quickly lose bone mass, eventually develop [osteoporosis][52], and be at a high risk for bone fractures. Skeletal and postural disfigurement may also eventually occur ([Figure][53]; [Figure][54]). In addition, the person is likely to experience other [menopause][55]-like symptoms, such as [hot flashes][56], mood and sleep problems, sexual dysfunction (e.g., low sexual desire, erectile dysfunction), and accelerated aging of the skin ([Wiki][57]). An increased risk of weight gain, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia may be associated with sex hormone deficiency as well. As such, extended deprivation of both androgens and estrogens with no estrogenic supplementation is not advisable.

   [56]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_flash
   [57]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol#Skin_health

With that said, a couple of clarifications should be made. Due to preservation of estradiol levels, high-dose bicalutamide monotherapy has minimal to no risk of bone density loss or most other menopausal symptoms. In addition, the low-dose cyproterone acetate plus low-dose bicalutamide option may have less of a risk of menopausal symptoms and possibly osteoporosis as well. This is because high-dose progestogens (of which “low-dose” cyproterone acetate certainly qualifies) can help treat certain menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and possibly bone density loss, and also because some estradiol will be preserved (since testosterone will only be suppressed by 70 to 80% rather than more fully). With that said however, in the latter case, it’s probably best not to take any risks. 

###  Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) 

Instead of only androgen and estrogen deprivation, the inclusion of [selective estrogen receptor modulators][58] (SERMs), so-called partial estrogens, can be employed. These medications are [partial agonists][59] of the estrogen receptor, and have mixed estrogenic and [antiestrogenic][60] effects depending on the tissue. For example, the SERM raloxifene has estrogenic effects in bone, fat tissue, and the liver, but antiestrogenic effects in the breasts. In general, SERMs reduce bone density loss and osteoporosis risk while not causing breast development (and actually blocking it). A full list of SERMs can be found [here][61]. However, practically speaking, only [raloxifene][62] (Evista), [tamoxifen][63] (Nolvadex), and [toremifene][64] (Fareston) are available, inexpensive, and commonly used. For an overview of the estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects of the different SERMs in different tissues, see [here][65]. In general, SERMs have a fairly similar pattern of effects. Although we have some idea of the differential tissue effects of SERMs, in many cases we do not know how they behave in specific tissues. For example, only a single clinical study has shown that a SERM, specifically raloxifene, has estrogenic effects in fat tissue ([Francucci et al., 2014][66]). In addition, it’s less clear how SERMs behave in, for example, skin, or in most of the brain.

SERMs also have various side effects. For instance, SERMs commonly produce hot flashes as an adverse effect. However, the fairly recently introduced combination of [bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogens][67] (Duavee) has been found to reduce the incidence of hot flashes in postmenopausal women ([Duavee label][68]). It is still on-patent and hence is expensive however. In any case, SERMs are also likely to produce other menopause-like symptoms. Additionally, SERMs have estrogenic effects in the liver and therefore influence production of coagulation factors and decrease production of [insulin-like growth factor-1][69] (IGF-1), among other potentially undesirable changes. Due to the increase in coagulation with SERMs, they have a notable risk of blood clots and cardiovascular complications like stroke ([Aly W., 2020][70]). Some SERMs, like tamoxifen, also have unique [off-target actions][71] and risks, for instance rare liver toxicity. Raloxifene is a more [selective][72] and probably safer SERM than tamoxifen.

SERMs are effective for maintaining bone density. However, they are, unfortunately, only partially estrogenic in bone and hence are submaximally effective for such purposes—they are significantly more effective than no treatment at all but are not as effective as estrogens ([Dane et al., 2007][73]; [Zirilli et al., 2009][74]; [Birzniece et al., 2012][75]; [Vestergaard, 2012][76]). Indeed, SERMs have actually been found to significantly antagonize the effects of estradiol on bone, for instance on bone density in premenopausal women ([Powles et al., 1996][77]; [Burshell et al., 1999][78]) and on [bone maturation][79] and [growth plate closure][80] in cisgender girls with [precocious puberty][81] ([Passone et al., 2015][82]). One study in elderly men suggested that 60 mg/day raloxifene is maximally equivalent in terms of bone density effect to estradiol levels of about 26 pg/mL ([Doran et al., 2001][83]; [Palacios et al., 2020][84]). Below this estradiol level, raloxifene was estrogenic on bone density, whereas above this level, it was antiestrogenic on bone density (Doran et al., 2001; Palacios et al., 2020). As such, although SERMs increase bone density in the context of very low estradiol levels, they are not as effective as estrogens in terms of maintaining bone density and they may still allow for significantly decreased bone density when added to androgen deprivation in non-binary transfeminine people.

###  Low-Dose Estrogen Supplementation 

An alternative to SERMs for avoiding estrogen deficiency is low-dose estrogen therapy. A dosage of oral estradiol of about 1 to 2 mg/day or estradiol levels of about 30 to 50 pg/mL (via another route, for instance transdermal patches) is all that is needed for complete or near-complete prevention of bone density loss ([Barbieri, 1992][85]; [Roux, 1997][86]; [Hadji, Colli, & Regidor, 2019][87]). Moreover, estradiol has a better tolerability and safety profile than SERMs, with a much lower risk of blood clots ([Aly W., 2020][88]). 

   [85]: https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9378(92)91706-G
   [86]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9513613/

   [88]: https://transfemscience.org/articles/estrogens-coagulation-blood-clots/

A problem with estrogen therapy however is that in the absence of androgens, estrogens even at low levels will induce substantial feminization and breast development. Estradiol levels in normal cisgender girls gradually increase from around 5 to 10 pg/mL at the start of puberty to 50 or 60 pg/mL by late puberty, and these low levels produce full developent of the female secondary sex characteristics ([Aly W., 2020][89]). Similarly, cisgender females with [complete androgen insensitivity syndrome][90] (CAIS) have estradiol levels of only about 35 pg/mL on average yet have complete feminization and excellent breast development ([Aly W., 2020][91]; [Wiki-Table][92]). Hence, the addition of low-dose estradiol to androgen deprivation would likely be a full transition. Very low doses of estradiol, for instance 0.5 mg/day oral estradiol or a 14 μg/day estradiol patch, achieving estradiol levels of only maybe 20 pg/mL, may be feasible and may result in less feminization. But, while effective for improving bone density (Dane et al., 2007; Birzniece et al., 2012), such doses/levels would not fully protect against bone density loss and other menopause-like symptoms and would likely still produce at least partial feminization. It’s notable that even GnRH agonists/antagonists and gonadectomy alone—which reduce estradiol levels to around 10 pg/mL—have a rate of mild gynecomastia of as high as 15% ([Di Lorenzo et al., 2005][93]).

###  Other Therapies for Bone Maintenance 

In addition to SERMs and estrogens, other measures to maintain bone mineral density are effective and could be included for further benefit to bone health. Examples include [calcium supplementation][94], [vitamin D supplementation][95], and [bisphosphonates][96] like [alendronic acid][97] (Fosamax) and [zoledronic acid][98] (Zometa) ([Chen, Ko, & Chen, 2019][99]; [Rizzoli, 2018][100]). Bisphosphonates have adverse effects and risks however. [Weight-bearing][101] [exercise][102] is also beneficial for bone density (Rizzoli, 2018).

Interestingly, spironolactone was found at 100 mg/day to fully prevent GnRH agonist-induced bone density loss in women in a small randomized controlled trial ([Moghetti et al., 1999][103]). The authors hypothesized that this was due to its [antimineralocorticoid][104] activity, as [aldosterone][105] is negatively correlated with bone density (Moghetti et al., 1999). However, in another study, 100 mg/day spironolactone did not prevent bone density loss caused by high-dose progestogen therapy in the form of 5 mg/day [lynestrenol][106] in women ([Preželj & Kocijančič, 1994][107]; [Preželj & Kocijančič, 1999][108]). Hence, spironolactone shouldn’t be relied upon for preservation of bone density.

###  Onset and Reversibility of Bone Loss 

Certain medications used in premenopausal women suppress gonadal sex hormone production and are associated with decreased bone density. These therapies can provide insight on the risk of bone density loss that may occur in non-binary transfeminine people deprived of sex hormones. Examples of such medications include progestogen-only birth control, which partially suppresses estradiol levels (to around 20–50 pg/mL) (Hadji, Colli, & Regidor, 2019), and GnRH agonists/antagonists, which partially to fully suppress estradiol levels depending on the medication and dose. Minimal or no bone density loss occurs with estradiol levels of 30 to 50 pg/mL, whereas significant bone density loss occurs with estradiol levels of 20 to 30 pg/mL (Hadji, Colli, & Regidor, 2019). Reassuringly however, bone density has been found to substantially or fully recover within a few years following discontinuation of progestogen-only birth control in young premenopausal women ([Nelson, 2010][109]). Along similar lines, therapy with the GnRH antagonist [elagolix][110] is considered to be acceptably safe in premenopausal women for up to 2 years at a dose that results in partial suppression of estradiol levels (to about 40 pg/mL) and for up to 6 months at a dose that results in maximal suppression of estradiol levels (to about 10 pg/mL) ([Wiki][111]). As such, a limited period of sex hormone deprivation—for instance as a trial of non-binary transfeminine hormone therapy—may be reasonably safe in terms of bone health. Long-term therapy should include adequate measures to avoid bone density loss however.

##  Prevention of Breast Development 

###  Estrogen Blockade and Suppression 

If the goal is to produce full demasculinization and some or full feminization with the sole exception of breast development, there are a number of ways to possibly achieve this. Androgen deprivation without estrogen supplementation will achieve demasculinization without any feminization or breast development (except for bicalutamide monotherapy of course). However, it’s not recommended for reasons described above and wouldn’t provide feminization. SERMs are an option; in addition to their capacity to treat osteoporosis, they are used to treat gynecomastia in men, and are capable of fully blocking gynecomastia induced by estrogens when used at sufficient doses ([Fentiman, 2018][112]). However, SERMs may allow for only partial feminization rather than full. [Aromatase inhibitors][113], in contrast to SERMs, have no apparent place in this form of hormone therapy, as they are, surprisingly, poorly effective for prevention of gynecomastia ([Fagerlund et al., 2015][114]; [Bedognetti et al., 2010][115]).

###  Increased Testosterone Levels as a Problem with SERMs 

A problem with the use of SERMs to prevent breast development is that when they are used in a person assigned male at birth in whom the gonads are intact and testosterone levels are not suppressed, they will induce a substantial increase in gonadal testosterone production and hence circulating testosterone levels. In men with hypogonadism (low testosterone levels), the SERMs [clomifene][116] (20–50 mg/day) and [enclomifene][117] (12.5–25 mg/day) increase testosterone levels from about 200–300 ng/dL to about 450–600 ng/dL on average (a change of about 2.0- to 2.5-fold, with an absolute increase of 250–400 ng/dL in this patient population) ([Bach, Najari, & Kashanian, 2016][118]; [Trost & Khera, 2014][119]). Because they are so effective at increasing testosterone levels, SERMs are used to treat male hypogonadism as an alternative to exogenous testosterone administration. Worse still, SERMs appear to cause even greater increases in testosterone levels in non-hypogonadal men. One study found that 50 mg/day clomifene increased testosterone levels by about 850 ng/dL in healthy younger men and by about 500 ng/dL in elderly men (Trost & Khera, 2014). Similarly, strong increases in testosterone levels have been observed with partial suppression of estradiol levels via aromatase inhibition in young and older men ([T’Sjoen et al., 2005][120]; [Raven et al., 2006][121]; [de Ronde et al., 2009][122]).

   [118]: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11930-016-0089-7

   [122]: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2265.2009.03573.x

If testosterone levels are suppressed, increases in testosterone levels with SERMs will, depending on the degree of testosterone suppression, be less applicable (e.g., with high-dose progestogen therapy) or not applicable at all (e.g., with medical/surgical castration). However, if a SERM is combined with, say, bicalutamide alone, the situation may become even worse. This is because bicalutamide itself produces considerable increases in testosterone levels similarly to SERMs. In elderly men with prostate cancer, bicalutamide monotherapy induces a 1.5- to 2.0-fold rise in testosterone levels, increasing them from about 300–400 ng/dL to about 500–600 ng/dL (an absolute change of about 150–250 ng/dL) ([Wiki][123]). In healthy younger men, bicalutamide may increase testosterone levels into the upper end of the normal male range (potentially into the range of around 900–1,200 ng/dL) ([Wiki][123]). 

   [123]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology_of_bicalutamide#Influences_on_hormone_levels

As bicalutamide is a competitive antagonist of the androgen receptor, its efficacy is fundamentally both dose-dependent and dependent on testosterone levels. Consequently, in combination with a SERM, it is possible that testosterone levels will become too high for bicalutamide to block. Moreover, endogenous androgens and estrogens are together responsible for maintaining normal homeostatic negative feedback on the [hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis][124] (HPG axis) in people assigned male at birth. It seems logical that with little to suppress the axis, gonadal production and hence circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol may simply continue to rise until they overwhelm bicalutamide and/or the SERM it’s combined with and restore negative feedback on the HPG axis. For these reasons, it’s possible that the combination of bicalutamide and a SERM alone might not be a practical option for non-conventional feminizing hormone therapy. 

   [124]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93gonadal_axis

With all of that said however, the combination of bicalutamide and tamoxifen has been assessed in various studies in men with prostate cancer ([PubMed][125]), and increases in testosterone levels have, rather surprisingly, not been a problem in these studies. In terms of the findings, bicalutamide and tamoxifen together do, as expected, increase total testosterone levels. However, the rise in total testosterone levels is not much different from that which occurs with bicalutamide alone. Moreover, free testosterone levels are either increased to a certain degree or are not actually raised at all ([Boccardo et al., 2005][126]; [Saltzstein et al., 2005][127]; [Fradet et al., 2007][128]). This is thought to be due to the fact that SERMs have potent estrogenic effects in the liver and result in increased production of [sex hormone-binding globulin][129] (SHBG), consequently reducing the fraction of free and hence bioactive testosterone in the circulation. This serves to offset the biological influence of the increase in total testosterone levels. In accordance, and reassuringly, unfavorable changes in markers of androgen receptor signaling, like higher [prostate-specific antigen][130] (PSA) levels, have not been observed relative to bicalutamide alone in the studies. 

   [125]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=bicalutamide[title]+tamoxifen[title]
   [126]: http://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2005.12.013
   [127]: https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.pcan.4500782

   [129]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_hormone-binding_globulin
   [130]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate-specific_antigen

It’s not clear why studies of bicalutamide plus tamoxifen have observed increases in total testosterone levels that are not that different from those of bicalutamide alone. Whatever the reason, these studies suggest that the combination of bicalutamide and tamoxifen (or certain other SERMs) might actually be feasible still for non-conventional feminizing hormone therapy. With that said however, elderly men are a different patient population than non-binary transfeminine people. Older men have diminished increases in testosterone levels with bicalutamide and SERMs compared to healthy young men. In relation to this, the combination might not be as favorable for younger people assigned male at birth. 

Tamoxifen very well may be exchangeable with raloxifene for use in combination with bicalutamide. However, it should be noted that in contrast to tamoxifen, raloxifene has never been studied in combination with bicalutamide. Or, at least, not in gonadally intact men; one study of bicalutamide with raloxifene in castrated men with prostate cancer does exist, but that doesn’t provide much in the way of useful information ([Ho et al., 2017][131]). Nor has raloxifene actually been properly studied for prevention of gynecomastia. A single retrospective chart review reported that it was effective for pubertal gynecomastia in boys ([Lawrence et al., 2004][132]). But that’s all the data we have. Conversely, there are many high-quality studies of tamoxifen for prevention of gynecomastia, including in combination with bicalutamide. 

   [131]: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clgc.2016.08.026
   [132]: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2004.03.057

In any case, used by themselves in men, raloxifene has been found to result in lower increases in testosterone levels than tamoxifen or toremifene ([Tsourdi et al., 2009][133]). As such, bicalutamide and raloxifene together may indeed be similar in terms of testosterone levels relative to the combination of bicalutamide and tamoxifen. This might just be due to raloxifene having lower efficacy as a SERM than tamoxifen or toremifene at the relevant clinical doses however (Tsourdi et al., 2009).

###  Topical Androgens 

Another possibility for prevention of breast development is topical application of a non-aromatizable androgen (i.e., an androgen that can’t be converted into an estrogen), namely [dihydrotestosterone][134] (DHT; Andractim), to the breasts. Androgens substantially oppose the actions of estrogens in the breasts, and both topical and systemic DHT have been reported to be effective in the treatment of gynecomastia similarly to SERMs in a number of small studies ([Kuhn et al., 1982][135]; [Kuhn et al., 1983a][136]; [Kuhn et al., 1983b][137]; [Eberle & Keenan, 1985][138]; [Eberle, Sparrow, & Keenan, 1986][139]; [Caron et al., 1987][140]; [Keenan, Fagan, & Richards, 1989][141]; [De Corrado et al., 1998][142]; [Benveniste, Simon, & Herson, 2001][143]). Other systemic androgens like nandrolone ([Heresová et al., 1981][144]; [Heresová & Vrzanova, 2003][145]) and danazol ([Buckle, 1980][146]; [Ting, Chow, & Leung, 2000][147]) have been reported to be effective as well.

Unfortunately, pharmaceutical topical DHT is only available today in France ([Drugs.com][148]). Some compounding pharmacies in certain countries might provide topical DHT preparations. However, DHT does not seem to be available from any compounding pharmacies in the United States. In contrast to DHT, testosterone readily converts into estradiol via aromatization and can actually induce some gynecomastia due to excessive estrogenic exposure. As such, unlike non-aromatizable androgens like DHT, use of testosterone for this purpose isn’t appropriate. There are few or no other options for topical androgens besides testosterone and DHT, so the practicality of this route is limited. 

   [148]: https://www.drugs.com/international/androstanolone.html

In contrast to SERMs, topical androgens may not be fully effective for preventing breast development. In addition, topical application of androgens to the breasts is very likely to cause local body hair growth and other local androgenic effects (e.g., masculine skin changes, oily skin, acne), which for many transfeminine individuals is probably unacceptable. Lastly, there is a risk of systemic distribution of the topically applied androgen ([Kuhn et al., 1983a][149]) and hence androgenic or masculinizing effects elsewhere in the body. This risk would be lessened in combination with an androgen receptor antagonist like bicalutamide however, although androgen receptor antagonists also risk blocking the local effects of the topical androgen. 

   [149]: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2265.1983.tb00026.x

###  Breast Removal Surgery and Breast Irradiation 

Two non-medication-based alternatives for prevention of breast development are prophylactic surgical breast removal and prophylactic breast irradiation. 

If there is no excess skin, mastectomy, or breast removal surgery, can remove the breasts without leaving obvious scars, as was the case in [this][150] young transgender man. Mastectomy is a highly effective means of preventing breast development. Of course, it requires surgery however. 

   [150]: https://i.imgur.com/hdcqJoh.jpg

Exposure of the breasts to radiation inhibits subsequent breast development ([Photos][151]). Irradiation of the breasts is an inexpensive, easy, and effective technique that is commonly used as prophylaxis against gynecomastia in men with prostate cancer treated with estrogens or high-dose bicalutamide monotherapy ([Viani, da Silva, & Stefano, 2012][152]). It is less effective than SERMs however and generally only reduces the severity of gynecomastia rather than fully prevents it ([Viani, da Silva, & Stefano, 2012][152]). More concerningly, there is a theoretical increased risk of breast cancer with exposure of the breasts to radiation ([Aksnessæther et al., 2018][153]). Research has found a 100-fold higher incidence of breast cancer in young women whose breasts were exposed to radiation during childhood as a consequence of radiotherapy for cancer when compared to other young women ([Zacharin, 2010][154]). On the other hand, limited available evidence so far suggests minimal if any increase in breast cancer incidence in elderly men on androgen deprivation and/or estrogen therapy treated with breast irradiation to prevent gynecomastia ([Aksnessæther et al., 2018][153]; [Viani, da Silva, & Stefano, 2012][152]). However, cancer radiotherapy and other forms of radiation exposure increase the risk of breast cancer in men, particularly those exposed at a young age ([Niewoehner, 2008][155]; [Giordano, 2005][156]). In addition to theoretical cancer risk, heart and lung issues have been associated with breast irradiation in elderly men with prostate cancer ([Tunio et al., 2012][157]; [Viani, da Silva, & Stefano, 2012][152]). Due to these health risks, breast irradiation for prevention of breast development is an inadvisable option.

   [157]: https://doi.org/10.3747/co.19.993

An obvious drawback of breast development prevention with both surgical breast removal and prophylactic breast irradiation is that they are irreversible. If the person ever changes their mind about not wanting breasts or eventually decides to fully transition (a not uncommon occurrence), there is no going back on the choice to permanently negate breast development. 

###  Degree, Onset, and Reversibility of Breast Development 

For reasons that are not entirely clear, it’s notable that transfeminine people tend to have poor or suboptimal breast development relative to cisgender women ([Wierckx, Gooren, & T’Sjoen, 2014][158]; [de Blok et al., 2018][159]; [Reisman, Goldstein, & Safer, 2019][160]). Likewise, in generally elderly men with prostate cancer, high-dose bicalutamide monotherapy and high-dose estrogen therapy both cause high rates of gynecomastia but produce only mild-to-moderate gynecomastia in 90% of cases ([Wiki][161]; [Ockrim et al., 2003][162]). (Whether their advanced age is a factor here or not is uncertain but could be involved however.) Hence, any person who was assigned male at birth should, generally speaking or _on average_, not necessarily expect a marked degree of breast development. Small breasts should generally be anticipated as the most likely outcome. There are always exceptions however, with a subset of transfeminine people experiencing substantial breast development. Hence, the degree of breast development one experiences is a matter of chance, and caution should be advised. 

   [158]: https://doi.org/10.1111/jsm.12487
   [159]: https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2017-01927

   [162]: https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ju.0000061024.75334.40

There are a few things to be aware of about breast development. One is that it happens slowly and is not something that becomes substantial overnight. Another is that will not continue to progress if hormones are withdrawn. And finally, it seems to be at least partially reversible if medications are discontinued within a certain amount of time (e.g., one year) ([Mancino, Young, & Bland, 2018][163]; [Kanakis et al., 2019][164]). However, a study found that bicalutamide monotherapy-induced gynecomastia outcome was worse if tamoxifen was introduced within a month of symptom onset rather than used from the start of therapy ([Serretta et al. 2012][165]). In any case, for the preceding reasons, a given individual could self-monitor their breast development, and, if it becomes too much for their liking, alter their medication regimen as desired in order to prevent further or reverse existing breast growth. Hence, breast development may not be something that should be feared excessively.

##  Summary and Conclusions 

Taken together, for the purpose of achieving maximal demasculinization and partial to maximal feminization with the exception of minimal or no breast development in non-binary transfeminine people, the following potential hormone therapy options may be useful: 

  1. A high-dose progestogen such as low-dose cyproterone acetate or high-dose rectal progesterone plus an androgen receptor antagonist like bicalutamide or high-dose spironolactone in combination with a SERM or very-low-dose estradiol
  2. A GnRH agonist or antagonist or gonadectomy plus a SERM or very-low-dose estradiol
  3. High-dose bicalutamide plus a SERM (possibly—testosterone increases may be problematic)

As well as variations thereof, for instance regimens additionally or alternatively including 5α-reductase inhibitors, a topical androgen applied directly to the breasts, nandrolone decanoate, and/or breast removal surgery, as well as further bone density interventions such as calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation, bisphosphonates, and/or weight-bearing exercise. 

Low-to-moderate-dose estradiol monotherapy, resulting in only partial suppression of testosterone levels, may also be a useful and fairly simple approach for non-binary transfeminine hormone therapy, although significant breast development is likely to occur with this option. 

In June 2021, the following review on SERMs for non-binary transfeminine people was published: 

  * Xu, J. Y., O’Connell, M. A., Notini, L., Cheung, A. S., Zwickl, S., & Pang, K. C. (2021). Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators: A Potential Option For Non-Binary Gender-Affirming Hormonal Care? _Frontiers in Endocrinology_, _12_, 701364. [DOI:[10.3389/fendo.2021.701364][166]]

   [166]: https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2021.701364

The article is the first literature of its kind. In relation to the lack of evidence for the efficacy and safety of SERMs in non-binary transfeminine hormone therapy at present, it stated that SERMs should not be routinely recommended to non-binary transfeminine people. However, it was cautiously permissive of their use in non-binary transfeminine people who request them and provide informed consent. The review concluded that SERMs are a theoretically attractive potential option for non-binary transfeminine hormone therapy and called for clinical research on them for these purposes.
